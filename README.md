<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Faruk, and I am a Software engineer. I have professional experience with JS/TS technologies, but I also like to experiment with and learn other languages and tools.

I am currently working on my hobby project, [ZDnevnik](https://github.com/kapobajza/ZDnevnik). It is a web app made with **Svelte** and **Fastify** on the BE.

If you need help with React, React Native, Node or web development in general, you can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fseremet/). I would be glad if I could help. ðŸ˜„
